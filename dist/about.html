              <p>
            Jjumba Martin (Kampala, 1989) I was born in Uganda, and all my life
            can be traced to the country. In 2009, I discovered a budding
            relationship between Photography and me while undertaking a
            Procurement Bachelor’s degree at University. I firmly believe that
            photography came to me when I needed it most and heeding the
            photography call was like walking right into what I was created to
            do. What began as a passionate hobby took up most of my time at
            University. Through that period, I applied myself to the teachings
            and learnings of different photographers through their works and
            from all sorts of online platforms. I am continually growing as a
            photographer and forever glad that my path landed me here at the
            intersection of cameras and people. I am more of a Documentary and
            Portrait Photographer, but open to taking on other related
            assignments. I hope that while you’re looking through my gallery,
            you find a way into my heart. Should you feel a connection, I will
            be eagerly waiting to hear from you. I am self-represented and based
            in Kampala, Uganda, but I am not hesitant to travel for projects in
            other countries. 2022.
